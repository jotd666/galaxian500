/*
Conventions: 

NUMBERS
=======

The term "@ $" means "at memory address in hexadecimal". 
e.g. @ $1234 means "refer to memory address 1234" or "program code @ memory location 1234" 

The term "#$" means "immediate value in hexadecimal". It's a habit I have kept from 6502 days.
e.g. #$60 means "immediate value of 60 hex" (96 decimal)

If I don't prefix a number with $ or #$ in my comments, treat the value as a decimal number.


LABELS
======
I have a labelling convention in place to help you identify the important parts of the code quicker.
Any subroutine labelled with the SCRIPT_ , DISPLAY_ or HANDLE_ prefix are critical "top-level" functions responsible 
for calling a series of "lower-level" functions to achieve a given result.   

If this helps you any, think of the "top level" as the main entry point to code that achieves a specific purpose.  

Routines prefixed HANDLE_ manage a particular aspect of the game.
    For example, HANDLE_PLAYER_MOVE is the core routine for reading the player joystick and moving the player ship. 
    HANDLE_PLAYER_SHOOT is the core routine for reading the player fire button and spawning a bullet.

I expect the purpose of DISPLAY_ is obvious.

SCRIPTS are documented below - see docs for SCRIPT_NUMBER ($4005)


ARRAYS, LISTS, TABLES
=====================

The terms "entry", "slot", "item", "record" when used in an array, list or table context all mean the same thing.
I try to be consistent with my terminology but obviously with a task this size that might not be the case.

Unless I specify otherwise, I all indexes into arrays/lists/tables are zero-based, 
meaning element [0] is the first element, [1] the second, [2] the third and so on.

FLAGS
=====
The terms "Clear", "Reset", "Unset" in a flag context all mean the flag is set to zero.
                                                                               

COORDINATES
===========

X,Y refer to the X and Y axis in a 2D coordinate system, where X is horizontal and Y is vertical.

The Galaxian monitor is rotated 90 degrees. This means that:
a) updating the hardware Y position of a sprite presents itself to the player as changing the horizontal position.
   To make a sprite appear to move left, you would increment its Y position.
   To make a sprite appear to move right, you would decrement its Y position.

b) updating the hardware X position of a sprite presents itself to the player as changing the vertical position. 
   To make a sprite appear to move up, you would decrement its X position.
   To make a sprite appear to move down, you would increment its X position.

So when you see code updating the Y coordinate when you would expect X to be updated, or vice versa, you now know why.

*
* The game follows what I call "scripts". A SCRIPT is a predefined sequence of STAGES (ie: subroutines) that implement an overall goal.
* The whole game is script-driven, from attract mode to the game itself.
*
* The NMI interrupt handler uses SCRIPT_NUMBER ($4005) to identify what script to run and, depending on the script, SCRIPT_STAGE ($400A) to 
* determine what subroutine to call to do the work for that stage of the script.  When the subroutine has completed its work, 
* it increments SCRIPT_STAGE which is akin to, "OK, I'm done; proceed to next stage of script".
*
* For example, a script for HELLO WORLD might be implemented as three stages:
* 1. Display Hello World on screen. Set SCRIPT_STAGE to 2.
* 2. Wait for key. Set SCRIPT_STAGE to 3 after key pressed.
* 3. Terminate program.
*
* When I've finished working out what all the scripts do, I'll replace the Hello World above with a real example from the game.
*
*
* The main take-aways from the above are:
* 1. The whole game is driven by the NMI interrupt.
* 2. Script stage and number are really just indexes into jump tables. 
*
* see $00CA for the NMI script handler.

* $40C0 to $40FF is reserved for a circular queue. The queue is comprised of byte pairs representing a command and parameter.
* NB: I term the byte pair a *Queue Entry* in the code @$08f2 and $200A.
*
* As 64 bytes are reserved for the queue, that means 32 commands and parameters can be stored. 
*
* The memory layout of the queue is quite simple.

* $40C0: command A

* $40C2: command B
* $40C3: parameter for command B

* ALIEN_IN_COLUMN_FLAGS is an array 16 bytes in size. Each byte contains a bit flag specifying if there are any aliens in a specific column. 
* IMPORTANT: The flags are ordered from rightmost column of aliens to the leftmost. Only 10 of the flags are used.
* 
* In a nutshell:
* $41F0..$41F2: unused. Always set to 0.
* $41F3: set to 1 if any aliens are in the rightmost column of the swarm.
* $41F4: set to 1 if any aliens are in the 2nd rightmost column of the swarm.
* $41F5: set to 1 if any aliens are in the 3rd rightmost column of the swarm.
* ..
* $41FC: set to 1 if any aliens are in the leftmost column of the swarm.
* $41FD..$41FF: unused. Always set to 0.
*
* The flags have three purposes: 
* 1: To halt the swarm when a bullet is getting too close (see $0936)
* 2: to calculate how far the swarm can scroll before it needs to change direction (see $093E)
* 3: to find aliens at the swarm edges to attack the player (see code from $137B onwards) 
*
*
* To further clarify in case there's any confusion, let's assume you've just started the game and you're on the first level. 
* You haven't shot anything yet. The alien swarm will be in the following formation:
*
*      F  F                     F = Flagship row  
*     RRRRRR                    R = Red alien row
*    PPPPPPPP                   P = Purple alien row
*   BBBBBBBBBB                  B = Blue alien row
*   BBBBBBBBBB
*   BBBBBBBBBB 
*
* Press PAUSE in MAME and open the memory debugger at location $41F0.
* The flags will look like so in the MAME memory window:
* 00 00 00 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 00 00 00
*
* You'll note that there are 10 flags set to TRUE (01) in a row. That is because the bottommost row has 10 blue aliens. 
* If you were to shoot the blue aliens in the rightmost column, you would see the first 01 (at memory address $41F3) turn into a 0, 
* meaning that column no longer contains any aliens. 
* 
* 0 is also written to the flags when the only alien in a column breaks off from the swarm to attack the player.
*

* This routine checks if a flagship and escort can break from a given flank to attack the player.
*
* The flank is determined by the ALIENS_ATTACK_FROM_RIGHT_FLANK flag (0x4215).
*
* If a flagship exists on the specified flank, send the flagship to attack.
* If there's red aliens in *close proximity* to the flagship, send a maximum of 2 as an escort.
*
* If there are no flagships on the specified flank, try to send a single red alien from the flank instead.
*
* Notes:
* A flagship can attack when:
*     HAVE_NO_ALIENS_IN_SWARM is set to 0 AND
*     HAS_PLAYER_SPAWNED is set to 1 AND
*     The CAN_FLAGSHIP_OR_RED_ALIENS_ATTACK is set to 1 AND

* The flagships stop attacking you completely.

*
* You may have noticed that when you're close to obliterating the swarm, that the background swarm noises
* get fewer and fewer, until there's no background noise, just the sound of attacking aliens and your bullets.
* This is the routine that handles the background noises. But this isn't the most important thing the routine does.
*
* Tucked away here is more important code, which affects the aliens aggressiveness. If you have 3 aliens or less
* in the swarm (inflight aliens don't count), the aliens are enraged and will be far more aggressive.
* Any aliens that take flight to attack you (inflight aliens) will never return to the swarm and keep attacking
* until either you or they are dead.
*
* If you wish to artificially enforce aggressiveness, pause the game and input the following into the MAME debugger:
*
* maincpu.mb@16e3=c9
* maincpu.mb@16e7=c9
* maincpu.pb@4224=1       // note the .pb, not .mb
*
* This will make the aliens attack you constantly - even when you start a new level.
