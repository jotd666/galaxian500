transcode:
- SCORE ADVANCE TABLE: missing dashes
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- wrong score when shooting aliens: test it, but DAA isn't emulated
- aliens attack only from left now, and only purple ones attack,
  others attack but seem unshown, and given some bogus positions of some bullets
  it seems that the alien positions are completely off
- send corrected transcode to Scott
- re-convert GENERATE_RANDOM_NUMBER
- debug HANDLE_SINGLE_ALIEN_ATTACK

amiga:

- game should run at 60Hz
- sound volume seems a bit low
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- when to play attack sound?
- extra life sound: implement
- implement cheat/debug key: stop aliens from attacking
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)
- sprite #0 has the highest priority, draw sprites in reverted order

Galaxian - like a lot of earlier games -
has a few 'nuances' for the sprites. For instance, all sprites have a
1-pixel adjustment for X, and sprites #0-2 have a 1-pixel adjustment for
Y (see the MAME source galaxian_v.cpp for details)

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
