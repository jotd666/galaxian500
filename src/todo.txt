transcode:
- getting the odd 'B' tile and the odd flagship 'tile' appearing
- OPT_START_LEVEL doesn't work (to test the 10 flag)
- improve attack looped sound quality

amiga:

- support dip switches from CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek
- joypad controls: play for pause
- flagship score doesn't show after a while (seems ok now??)
- stars as sprites:
  * blink/change from time to time
- readargs to set options
- add left/right/shift keys to play keyboard

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
