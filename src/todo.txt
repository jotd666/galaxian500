transcode:
- SCORE ADVANCE TABLE: missing dashes
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- wrong score when shooting aliens: test it, but DAA isn't emulated
- aliens attack only from left now, and only purple ones attack
- bullets don't seem to hit the player
- send corrected transcode to Scott
- re-convert GENERATE_RANDOM_NUMBER and CALCULATE_TANGENT
- debug HANDLE_SINGLE_ALIEN_ATTACK
- insert coin + press start when convoy intro is running, game starts convoy keeps on scrolling!!

amiga:
- shoot an alien inflight (graphics trashed)
  then debug see which part of code clears 0x538 (spr0 copper data)

- bullets aren't erased properly, sprites aren't either after a while (related to see above)
- optimize draw_enemy_bullets (read (a0) only once)
- game should run at 60Hz
- sound volume seems a bit low
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- flying alien shot: animation is wrong and seems to destroy other sprites
- when to play attack sound?
- extra life sound: implement
- implement cheat/debug key: stop aliens from attacking
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)

Galaxian - like a lot of earlier games -
has a few 'nuances' for the sprites. For instance, all sprites have a
1-pixel adjustment for X, and sprites #0-2 have a 1-pixel adjustment for
Y (see the MAME source galaxian_v.cpp for details). Also - unlike
Xevious - sprite #0 has the highest priority.

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
