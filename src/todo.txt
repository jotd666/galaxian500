transcode:
- check how swarm sound loop and how is it turned off/on (volume?)
- getting the odd 'B' tile and the odd flagship 'tile' appearing: debug with uaedbg
  in the middle of the screen
- attack sound end (looped) not correct, should play only when alien is not returning to swarm
- OPT_START_LEVEL doesn't work

amiga:

- bobs corruption (double buffering issue, ok without it)
  can't drop double buffering on slow configs. Only ok on whdload/chip
  fails on all other configs, whdload chip/fast big system...
- whdload+fastmem: crashing whdload, no splash screen (winuae issue??)
- support dip switches from CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek
- joypad controls: play for pause / P pause
- flagship score doesn't show after a while
- stars as sprites:
  * blink/change from time to time
  * scrolling: working but with glitches only when game playing!!!
 
To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
