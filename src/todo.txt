transcode:
- SCORE ADVANCE TABLE: missing dashes
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- aliens seem to attack from swarm (disappear from swarm) 
  but aren't visible, also attacks are probably buggy

amiga:
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)
- draw alien bullets on back screen (setting white as colors 4-7)
- draw player bullets on front screen or use sprite for it
- game should run at 60Hz
- remove stuff from sprite sheet (ship, flags...) as they're characters
- rip sounds
