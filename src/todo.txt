transcode:
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- alien attacking but animation frame oscillates between 2 frames
- flagships attack but are lost forever when attacking. Only one red alien attacks!
- send corrected transcode to Scott
- re-convert GENERATE_RANDOM_NUMBER

amiga:

- player ship explosion sound sometimes not working
- shift hw sprites too? (explosions?)
- game should run at 60Hz
- sound volume seems a bit low
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- when to play attack sound?
- extra life sound: implement
- implement cheat/debug key: stop aliens from attacking
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)


Galaxian - like a lot of earlier games -
has a few 'nuances' for the sprites. For instance, all sprites have a
1-pixel adjustment for X, and sprites #0-2 have a 1-pixel adjustment for
Y (see the MAME source galaxian_v.cpp for details)

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
