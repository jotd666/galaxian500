transcode:
- swarm sound loop
- alien attacking but animation frame sometimes oscillates between 2 frames
- at the end of the level (not a lot of aliens), aliens joining swarm seems bogus
- no swarm: alien still joins non-existing swarm for a little while before attacking
- send corrected transcode to Scott
- re-convert/check GENERATE_RANDOM_NUMBER

amiga:

- run in 68000 mode cycle exact to check if it runs properly
- player ship explosion sound sometimes not working (also kills other sounds)
- flagship kill score displayed wrong (hw sprite?) check if score is correct??
- shift hw sprites too? (explosions?)
- game should run at 60Hz
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- when to play attack sound?
- extra life sound: implement
- implement cheat/debug key: stop aliens from attacking
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause
- stars as sprites:
  * priority?
  * blink/change from time to time
  * try to display after PAL limit


To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
