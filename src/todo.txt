transcode:
- SCORE ADVANCE TABLE: missing dashes
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- aliens seem to attack from swarm (disappear from swarm) 
  but aren't visible, also attacks are probably buggy
- wrong score when shooting aliens: test it, but DAA isn't emulated

amiga:
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)
- draw alien bullets on back screen (setting white as colors 4-7)
- game should run at 60Hz
- rip more sounds
- sound volume seems a bit low
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- "1" start starts 2 player game
- alien explosions (should be sprites)
- alien kill sound
- extra life sound
- alien shot show explosion but probably bug as it hides shot sprite
- hide hw sprite if no longer a real sprite in slot (check current sprite state
  vs hw_sprite_slots in the end)
