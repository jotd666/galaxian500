transcode:
- SCORE ADVANCE TABLE: missing dashes
- swarm sound loop
- stars LFSR API
- aliens seem to attack from swarm (disappear from swarm) only from right 
  but aren't visible, also attacks are probably buggy
- sprite animation frames are wrong
- wrong score when shooting aliens: test it, but DAA isn't emulated

amiga:
- sprites of intro remain displayed
- emulate stars with sprites (mockup in python first)
- draw alien bullets on back screen (setting white as colors 4-7)
- game should run at 60Hz
- sound volume seems a bit low
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- alien explosions (should be sprites): not working too well
- alien kill sound: not working
- flagship kill sound: not working
- extra life sound: implement
- alien sprite issue / sprite 0 (player shot) gets set to 0
- implement cheat/debug key: stop aliens from attacking
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause

Galaxian - like a lot of earlier games -
has a few 'nuances' for the sprites. For instance, all sprites have a
1-pixel adjustment for X, and sprites #0-2 have a 1-pixel adjustment for
Y (see the MAME source galaxian_v.cpp for details). Also - unlike
Xevious - sprite #0 has the highest priority.

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
