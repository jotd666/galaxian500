transcode:
- improve attack looped sound quality

amiga:

- support dip switches from CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek
- stars as sprites:
  * blink/change from time to time
- bitplanes glitches with JIT
- check alien bullets colors: should be whiter? not yellow
- readargs to set options

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
