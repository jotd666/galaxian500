transcode:
- swarm sound loop and how is it turned off/on (volume?)
- collisions player vs aliens seem not to work for left side?: debug them
  (break when alien X and ship X are close)
- when attacking aliens goes too far on left/right => finds itself in the middle of the screen??
- send corrected transcode to Scott
- OPT_SMALL_SWARM=1 => at some point awards player 4 lives by mistake!
- grep for move to zero page (debug) remaining code
- add high score load/save support.
- OPT_START_LEVEL doesn't work

amiga:

- run in 68000 mode cycle exact to check if it runs properly: too slow!! check if row update optim
  is working or if it updates all
- maybe optimize player ship rows update: only blit where the ship is
  and only delete ship position depending on previous 2 values of scroll (double buffering)
- default dip switches should be 3 lives
- support more dip switches (CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek & whdload)
- when to play attack sound?
- if not fire first pressed & game not playing
  * credit 0: fire = insert coin
  * credit != 0: fire to start game
  * same for second player
- joypad controls: insert coin/start/play for pause
- stars as sprites:
  * priority?
  * blink/change from time to time
  * scrolling: working but with big glitches: slow it down to analyse copperlist
    when glitching

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
