Attention to A500/68000 users from floppy:

As surprising as it can be, the game had really to be shoehorned for the standard
A500 512 chip/512 slow 68000/7MHz configuration. Because of memory & CPU constraints
compromises had to be made:

- boot with ugly add36k to save some chipmem
- stars aren't scrolling
- part of screen is only 25Hz (attacking aliens still are 50Hz)

With those compromises, the game runs at full speed. With whdload on 68000 it is possible
to choose between "slow machine" or normal. Accelerated 68000 machines with fastmem can run
the game properly with all options on (full 50Hz, scrolling stars)
