transcode:
- improve attack looped sound quality: find the zeroes with the python script
  and use those values instead of bare divides

amiga:

- pause with button 2
- fix half hidden CREDIT line
- use sprite engine from Pengo (disappearing sprites sometimes)
- support dip switches from CLI but should be 1.3 compliant eeek
- stars as sprites:
  * blink/change from time to time
- readargs to set options

To rip the sounds:

- enter service mode (F2)
- press credit/fire/start to create various sounds (without swarm sound that I can't get rid of !!)
